# 🤟 Hand Sign Detection Using Python

This project detects hand signs representing **alphabet symbols (A-Z)** using computer vision techniques. It's built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras** for gesture classification. The model is trained on hand gesture images and can recognize static American Sign Language (ASL) letters.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand sign detection via webcam.
- Recognizes static ASL alphabet signs (A-Z).
- Preprocessing of hand region for accurate prediction.
- Visual output with prediction overlay.
- Simple and easy-to-extend architecture.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and webcam feed.
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning for hand sign classification.
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations.

## 📝 Notes

- Model accuracy can vary depending on lighting and background.
- You may need to adjust the ROI (region of interest) for better performance.
